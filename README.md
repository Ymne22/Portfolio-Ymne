## About This Project

I made this portfolio page using **Tailwind CSS** and plain old **JavaScript**.  
No back-end involved — I wanted to keep it simple and just make sure it *works* well.

Big shoutout to **VSC Copilot**, it definitely helped a lot along the way! :D

Feel free to use this project as a reference or starting point — it's licensed under the **MIT License**.  
Just one thing: **please don't use and claim my data or assets**. You’re welcome to reuse the layout and structure though~

That’s it. Have fun!
